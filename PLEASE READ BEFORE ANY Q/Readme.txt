Dear Professor Sandoval,

My name is Evan Friedlan (180922230). I was unable to complete Assignment 2 before the due date. I did not allow enough 
time to submit high quality work, however I have still attached the work I finished. Q1, Q2, and Q3 are all completed well, 
however Q4 is incomplete. I have attached an image containing my general plan for each page of the donut website, this may help
to read through the portion of code I have submitted. If possible, I am able to finish coding the remainder of the website after
the due date has passed(adding and formatting images and text, accessibility, new fonts, adaptivity to other devices, validation),
it would just require more time. Please email me if you have any questions about my submission, otherwise I will come speak with 
you after class about my situation, including late penalties and any other details if I am in fact allowed to submit after 
tonight (At the time of this writing it is Monday, Oct. 21 @ 11:59 PM). 

Thanks,

Evan
