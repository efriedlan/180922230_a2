      <p> Websites often reuse images and information on several pages and people often repeatedly return to the same website.
          A computer will download and store data from these websites in case they are needed again. This is called cacheing.
          A browser cache is space on a hard drive used to help speed up your browsing.
          The computer can access the hard drive faster than it can get something from the internet, so the cached files are
          stored locally instead of being accessed each time the website is loaded.
          Unfortunately, the cache can cause problems - the site may be changed by the owner,
          the cached data and cookies, a term for cached text files, may need to be updated, etc.
          In this situation the cache can be cleared, allowing a fresh copy of the website to be cached.
          In the case of a MailChimp form, it is presented to the user depending on whether they have already subscribed.
          This information is stored in the cache. When the cache/cookies are cleared, the website does not know if the user has been on
          the site before, causing the MailChimp form to appear without any previously entered information.
