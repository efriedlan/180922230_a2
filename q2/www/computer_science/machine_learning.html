          <strong> Ada Lovelace -  </strong>
          Born in London on December 10, 1815, Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer best known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Ada was the first to recognize the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers. Born to Lord and Lady Byron, she would lose her father in just four months. Lord Byron left England while Lady Byron raised Ada and promoted her interest in mathematics and logic. As a teenager, Ada had a long working relationship and friendship with "father of computers" Charles Babbage. She also came into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She later married William King, future Earl of Lovelace, becoming Countess of Lovelace in 1838. Between 1842 and 1843 Ada wrote a set of notes containing what many consider to be the first computer program, developing a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating until she died from cancer in 1852.
