              <strong> Alan Turing -  </strong>
              Born in London on June 23, 1912, Alan Turing was a mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. He formalised the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing Machine and is considered the father of artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science. Turing worked for British intelligence during the Second World War, developing cryptanalysis techniques for the breaking of German cyphers. His work cracking coded messages is estimated to have saved up to 14 million lives. After the war, Turing worked in prestigious laboratories until he was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He did not receive jail time but died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning. His life was later celebrated after a public apology and he would be depicted on the United Kingdom's new Â£50 note in 2019.
