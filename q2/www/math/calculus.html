                <p>
                  <strong> Isaac Newton -  </strong>
                  Sir Isaac Newton was born in Lincolnshire, England on January 4, 1643. Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time. He shares credit for developing calculus and made contributions to optics, in addition to publishing his book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, laying the foundations of classical mechanics. The book accounted for the workings of various phenomena such as tides and the motion of celestial bodies using the laws of motion and universal gravitation. His laws and theories would form the dominant scientific viewpoint until being replaced by the theory of relativity. Newton made numerous other contributions to many fields of science and mathematics and would also become a Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge. He was later knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life as president of the Royal Society and running the Royal Mint.
