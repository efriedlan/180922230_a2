          <strong> Florence Nightingale -  </strong>
          Florence Nightingale was an English social reformer and statistician from Florence, Italy.
          Also the founder of modern nursing, Nightingale was born on May 12, 1820. She came to prominence during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers, and later established a nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London - the first secular nursing school in the world. She was extremely important in the professionalization of nursing roles for women - the Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour. The annual International Nurses Day is also celebrated on her birthday. Nightingale pushed social reforms that improved and shaped British society while also being a prodigious writer and a pioneer in the use of infographics. She died at the age of 90 in 1910.
